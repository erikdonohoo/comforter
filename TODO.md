1. Get requests to /coverage going through middleware for Gitlab auth. Probably
have to get Laravel to serve up the angular app via PHP instead of directly
from public folder.

2. See if there is any other way around using jump-tunnel for gitlab URL
if not, then just update README.

3. Stop and try blowing everything away and seeing if you can get back
to a state where you are working on the project again quickly. Need to
add migration run to setup of project.
